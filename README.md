System-wide identification of enzyme substrates by thermal analysis
================

This package is for analysis of data generated by the method “System-wide identification of enzyme substrates by thermal analysis” or SIESTA. SIESTA relies on the fact that enzymatic post-translational modification of substrate proteins might change their thermal stability. This method has been successfully tested on three enzymatic systems selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase 1, protein kinase B (AKT1) and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase-10 systems, yielding known and putative protein substrates. SIESTA can enhance our understanding of the role of enzymes in homeostasis and disease, open new opportunities in investigating the effect of PTMs on protein stability, and facilitate drug discovery. SIESTA follows a thermal proteome profiling paradigm. Using this package, the raw proteomics data is normalized, curve fitting for all proteins is performed and melting points are calculated.
